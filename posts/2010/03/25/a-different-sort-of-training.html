<p>Monday afternoon, my tyre went flat, likely due to the 4+ separate construction sites between my apartment and CERN.  It took two days to fix, so in  the interim I ran or walked to and from work.  It was an important lesson, indeed, that running to work is not equivalent to biking to work.  It's a sight more difficult.<br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it gave me a chance to practise my repair skills.  I guess we'll need it.  :)<br />

<p>Victor (one of my coworkers) and I are planning a big ride this weekend around the lake.  I've been hoping to do this for several weekends, but invariably the week's weather is gorgeous and it just doesn't hold out to Saturday or Sunday.  Anyway, it'll be 180km in a day this Saturday.  Photos to come.  :)<br />

<p>In farm news, I sent messages to all the hosts we are hoping to stay with in Spain, Italy, and Greece.  I've gotten one response so far (from a farm in Italy), and it was affirmative, so we have at least one place to go this summer!  Huzzah!</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/03/22/training-begins.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/03/28/around-the-lake.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
