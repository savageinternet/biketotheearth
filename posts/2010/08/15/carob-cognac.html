Still hard, even when you have<br />
A real place to live.</i></p>
<p>We woke up, did some hoeing, scoured the ground for carobs, and were told that since it's Sunday we need not do anything else.  (p.s. did you know that carob is used in making diabetic chocolate?  It's actually the bean itself and not the seeds inside that have a bit of the flavour of chocolate.. I know this because Evan and I decided it might be fun to bite into them and see.  Anyway, carob goes for a reasonable price at markets around here.)</p>
<p>With not much to do work-wise, a dead computer, and an enormous backlog of blogposts to write, we decided that the best idea might be to head into town and park ourselves in a café to charge the ol' laptop and get some typin' done.  It was largely uneventful and relaxing, I guess.  We had some beers, tried some cognac from Jerez (a town we passed through some time ago in Spain), paid our super-reasonable 6€ for them, and hung out.</p>
<p>We actually don't get much time to "hang out." It seems strange, I guess.  We're together essentially all the time, and have been for some months now (3 today!), but when we're biking or cooking or seeing towns or whatever we tend to talk about the things going on around us more than anything else.  It was nice to just sit down (in the dark, since we got home sort of late and there's no electricity) and chat about the books we've been reading (I'm really enjoying <i>Storming Heaven</i>) and whatever else has been on our minds.</p>
<p>Yeah... that's about all.  Things are closed around here on Sunday.  It's a good day to relaaaaaaxxxxxxxxxxxxx....</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/14/explosions-in-the-night-sky.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/16/earth-wind-and-fire.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
