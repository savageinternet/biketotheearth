Abound in the city that<br />
Keeps you up all night.</i><br />
</p>
<p>So, Amsterdam.  It's an interesting place.  Sex shops and "coffeeshops" and the like are sprinkled through every corner of its red light district, which is, I guess, the only place most people see.  We decided that it would be a nice idea to head out of there for a while, so we packed up our laundry onto our backs (our clothes always smell like ass... it becomes too unpleasant to deal with after a while, and when we start gagging every time we put our shirts on, well, we know it's time to do laundry.  haha, just kidding.  :)) and struck out to find someplace to wash them.  Unfortunately, like many things in Europe, laundromats aren't open on Sundays, so we figured we were heading for disappointment.</p>
<p>To the south of the city (where our random walk led us), we found a large park which had exits onto a few interesting sights, including a Van Gogh museum.  We strolled that way-ward, and were very shortly disappointed to see the length of the line stretching in front.  That in conjunction with the fact that several signs indicated that the ticket booths were closed caused us to give up our dreams of having a lofty cultural experience in this city.</p>
<p>However, elsewhere in the park we found a chic caf√© with swings lining its periphery.  We sat in one and watched the storm blow around over our heads (carefully setting our laundry far enough away that we might not have to smell it all the time) for a while, then enjoyed our respective coffee and tea.  Eventually we realised that the booklets we'd gotten upon checking into our hostel indicated that there were washing facilities there, so we headed back to finally clean our junk.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went for a stroll (in clean clothes!) around the city to enjoy its rather lovely lights.  One of my favourite things was a bridge lit to look like a car (see the photos).</p>
<p>I guess that sounds like a fairly low-key day.  Maybe you can make up stories that make us sound more exciting.  Really.  Go wild.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/05/29/when-the-going-gets-weird.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/05/31/life-on-tv.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
