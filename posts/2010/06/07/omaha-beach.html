Not to be forgotten.  Strive<br />
To remember theirs.</i><br />
</p>
<p>I woke up this morning with a serious stomach problem that wouldn't allow me to eat properly.  I wanted, however, to see the American Military Cemetery we had been thwarted by yesterday evening, so we set out.  The going was slow.  But I am so happy we went.</p>
<p>The cemetery is staggering.  There are more than 10,000 American soldiers at rest there, and the site is at the top of Omaha beach, which is where they stormed for D-Day.  Looking at how the land lays and imagining fighting up the bluffs there is sobering, and the fields of neatly-spaced white crosses and stars of David standing over neatly-manicured emerald lawns are more than a bit heart-wrenching.  There simply isn't much I can say about going there.  There was a pile of flowers left by those who had been by, and a few couples and single people old enough to remember for themselves wandered through the rows.  I couldn't understand the man talking on his cellphone as he strolled around, or the gaggle of high school children laughing and punching each other's arms.  Although we couldn't make it for D-Day proper, tribute to this sort of thing shouldn't really have to have a day, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it for myself.</p>
<p>After the cemetery, I wasn't in shape to make it much further.  After about 20km, we had to call it quits, and I slept in the tent while Evan attempted to use our stove to prepare food for himself, only to discover that the pump was broken.  Some mechanically handy British people a couple campsites over helped him out, and I guess he wound up with a pretty tasty meal.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/06/06/requiescat-in-pace.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/06/08/a-new-lo.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
