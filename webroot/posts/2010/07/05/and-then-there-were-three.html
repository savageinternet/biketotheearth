</p>
<p>This morning found us being bums around the park again.  We woke up late (Venus was due in around 13h, and we figured we had some time..) and purchased a pile of food from the local supermarket: eggs, bread, pesto, cheese, and tomatoes.  We fried the eggs in delicious, delicious olive oil; added the pesto and some garlic powder to our bread; and stuffed everything together into our mouths.  It took longer than we expected, so we headed to the bus station approximately in time to see her step off the bus (we were a little early, and it gave us the chance to comment some photos for you lovely people!  :D).</p>
<p>She seemed disoriented.  Evidently she had spent roughly 40 hours in transit, about 10 of which were spent in the Madrid bus station half sleeping while waiting to head to Pamplona.  A note for travellers: bikes and busses go together in Spain.  Bikes are only allowed on some trains--mostly the ones that follow major-ish routes.  Look carefully at the <a href="http://renfe.es">renfe.es</a> website to see if your train is a medium or long distance train first!</p>
<p>Nevermind disorientation, though; it was time to see things!  The fact that we had so long in Pamplona meant that Evan and I spent some time poking around to find interesting things.  Mainly the thing she wanted to see was the bullring and the route of the Encierro, so we did that first.  It's amazing how long a half mile can seem...</p>
<p>She told us about her Navy cruise and all that jazz, and we settled in for a really interesting (read: way too big but rather delicious) dinner of rice, beans, corn, squash, onion, and local wine.  Venus was pretty tired out (fair enough, considering her journey!), so we headed back to the campsite fairly early and fell asleep, hoping to wake up early for the chupinazo tomorrow... SAN FERM√çN!!!!!</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/07/04/the-least-lazy-day-off-ever.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/posts/2010/07/06/chupinazo.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
