We reach the airport, exchange farewells, and are left to go through the usual round of security theatre. This time we must check a bag - Valkyrie finally received a package sent to CERN on her behalf which her ex-coworkers had been holding for her in anticipation of this visit, and which contained (among sundry other items of dire importance) a jar of peanut butter, a substance recently deemed by the airport authorities to be a liquid and therefore subject to the lilliputian restrictions on liquids...</p>
