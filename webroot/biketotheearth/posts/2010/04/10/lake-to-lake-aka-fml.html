Rural France make for lovely<br />
Scenes and my sad legs.</i></p>
<p>I like lakes.  They're so peaceful and calm: the water just floating around and minding its own business, people milling about and enjoying grassy or sandy lakesides (especially on a warm day like this one), ... So I jumped at the chance to go to Annecy, France, with two other coworkers, namely Hugo and Piotr.  It has a lovely lake and a gorgeous old town, and it's basically a composite built of all the things that Americans think about when they think of "romantic Europe."  Except the Eiffel Tower.  It didn't have that.<br />
</p>
<p>But there's this funny thing about lakes.  They tend to form in low areas.  That generally means that two lakes that aren't connected are separated by something like.. well, like a high area.  In this case, it was a very high hill.  I just did a map on mapmyride.com and it informs me that we climbed a total of 740m over our 120-ish km bike ride.  That's a shitload of climbing.  The woman at the restaurant we went to in Annecy didn't believe that we had come from Geneva.<br />
</p>
<p>We did get a late start (about 11:30 we left from Gen√®ve), but we got back shortly after sunset.  Not too shabby.  That includes an hour or so spent in Annecy touristing through the old town and stuffing our faces with as many calories as possible (in the form of pizza and pasta and ice cream).<br />
</p>
<p>All in all, the French countryside was really beautiful.  Unfortunately, France isn't so friendly to cyclists as Switzerland is; they don't have many bike lanes (we had to settle for the shoulder of small highways), and they lack open stops with fresh water.  We were honked at and stuff several times, but Piotr taught me some curse words in Polish, so that was okay.<br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, I can barely hold myself up to type this.  I think it's time for me to rest up.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/03/31/aversive-conditioning.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/04/12/welcome.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
