<p>More tech news from Bike to the Earth! After some long hours spent playing around with webcams duct-taped to handlebars, silly-looking yet happily functional GPS units, and Google Maps, we're proud to make three announcements:</p>
<h3>Flickr and YouTube!</h3>
<p>We're using our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/biketotheearth">Flickr photostream</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/biketotheearth">YouTube channel</a> to provide photos and videos along with each post.</p>
<h3>VeloCam!</h3>
<p>Take one $15 webcam, one laptop, one bike, some duct tape, and a metric whackload of Linux hackery and what do you get? The Bike to the Earth VeloCam! The videos at right were taken over test loops of roughly 10 and 25 km each. We'll be using a similar setup to provide day-by-day footage of the trip as we see it from our bikes.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define:+velocipede">see here</a> for a fun etymological tidbit.</p>
<h3>GPS!</h3>
<p>The map image at right was generated using data gathered by our GPS datalogger during a test walk around some nearby roads - not only will you have a video of each day, you'll also be able to see exactly where we went by looking at our daily map.</p>
<p>That's it for now! For the tech/geo/media geeks in the crowd, I'll be posting special features on the webcam and GPS setup shortly. One last shameless plug: if you're not already following us via at least one of our social channels, get on that! The links are in the top toolbar. Our activity is going to increase exponentially over the next few weeks - don't miss anything!</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/04/15/its-about-time-toronto.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/04/29/vancouver-in-the-green.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
