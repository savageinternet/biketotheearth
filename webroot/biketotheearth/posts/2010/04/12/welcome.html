<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the official website of Bike to the Earth. We're happy that you decided to drop by, and we're super-excited to hear more from you as we prepare for this ambitious journey. I'm <a href="http://evanstratford.com/">Evan Stratford</a>, and I'm here to say a short bit about the site.</p>
<p>A major part of this process is being able to share it with others; that's why we built this website. Take a second to check out some of the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>At top, we have our social media links. If you're looking for our Facebook page, Twitter feed, Flickr photostream, or YouTube channel, you'll find them up there. There's also an RSS feed.</li>
<li>At bottom is the timeline. Drag the mouse to move the timeline or use a/d to move backwards/forwards in time; use w/s to zoom in/out; click on an icon to jump to that event.</li>
<li>Have a really great idea for the site? Found a problem? Let us know! We've got a UserVoice forum set up; just click the feedback box at left.</li>
<li>Want to leave a comment? For now, we're using Facebook Connect; just log in to your Facebook account through our site and you'll be able to post comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we start taking pictures and videos of the training process, we'll be moving quickly to make those available both here and on our Flickr/YouTube pages.</p>
<p>Want to know how this site was built? Keep going!</p>
<h3>WARNING! TECHNICAL DETAILS AHEAD!</h3>
<p>(Don't say I didn't warn you.) If you're still reading, you probably want a peek at our technology stack. Here's a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>jQuery on frontend, with CSS3 techniques sprinkled throughout;</li>
<li>Pylons (a Python-based web framework) for mid-tier;</li>
<li>CouchDB for backend, accessed from mid-tier via python-couchdb;</li>
<li>git for source control, managed over SSH via gitosis;</li>
<li>WebFaction for hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more random points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding toolbars are incredibly easy to pull off; all it takes is jQuery animations and a bit of creative positioning.</li>
<li>We use jGrowl for the notifications at top-right.</li>
<li>We're using Facebook Connect for a bit more than comment posting; we also use it to identify site admins and grant them Super Cow Powers.</li>
<li>Yes, the timeline is completely DHTML/AJAX/CSS. No, it doesn't use Flash. No, it wouldn't be better in Flash. Next question :)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your burning inquiry hasn't been answered here, <em>ask!</em> As we said, we're glad to share this process with you; that means everything from physical training to, well, putting in full-day hacking sessions to make this site even more awesome than it already is.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/04/10/lake-to-lake-aka-fml.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/04/15/its-about-time-toronto.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
