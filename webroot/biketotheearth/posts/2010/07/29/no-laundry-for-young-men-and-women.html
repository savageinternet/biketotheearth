<p>The tour that we got from Javier yesterday was fabulous.  Since Evan missed it, we spent a part of today getting him up to speed on the Albayzin (the hilltop area of town which was the haunt of gypsies in the old days), the cave houses (for natural heating and cooling!), the monastery (bearing the sword cross and a part of the Order of Santiago; also they "make really good cakes," according to Javier), the schools of Padre Manjon (a priest from Burgos who founded centres of learning for the poor in Granada), and all the rest.</p>
<p>We also spent a rather frustrating few hours scouring the city looking for a self-service laundry place.  The only laundry place anyone could direct us to was full-service and charged an unfortunate 28â‚¬ for our wash.  We weren't willing to pay.</p>
<p>The good news is that Evan isn't so sick any longer.  The sort of lame news is that today was sort of lame.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/07/28/alhambraaaaaaaaa.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/07/30/olive-oil.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
