If nothing gets done, elsewise<br />
It's called a 'slow day.'</i><br />
</p>
<p>After leaving the lovely little seaside campsite in Châtelaillion Plage, we headed out with the ambitious plan to make it to Royan (or near to it), which would put us a small stone's throw away from our goal of Bordeaux.  That was how we started, anyway.</p>
<p>As we are getting ready for our giant trek up the Pyrénées and through Spain, we realise that our water supply is somewhat smaller than it should be.  We can each carry about 1.25L of water, which isn't really enough.  So we stopped at a store and picked up some new water bottles, upping each of our capacities to around 2L, which is still not enough, but it's much better than before (an extra half litre is about what you need for cycling an extra hour).</p>
<p>We also wanted a cutting board.  We haven't had the luxury, and have been using our tupperware container as a makeshift one.  Ugh.  So we picked up a cheap plastic placemat that will now serve.</p>
<p>We hadn't done laundry in some days, so... that got taken care of, too.</p>
<p>It's too hot to move in the middle of the day, so we took a couple hours' break in Rochefort's Mediatheque (it's the new word for library, since of course the library is now branding itself as a carrier of all media instead of just books).</p>
<p>Ugh.  With this plethora of small stops and things (we also acquired a few more small items we'd been lacking), we didn't make it very far today.  We're staying in a small town called Saint Agnant.  We've actually dubbed it the Zeven of France: shops here are reasonable to the point that some of them ARE STILL OPEN AT 20H.  We went out and BOUGHT PASTRIES... AFTER DINNER.</p>
