<p>Hi, Mom, we have a new phone now.</p>
<p>We also attempted to get a 3G stick for use with our laptop, but all the ones that Orange sells are incompatible with Ubuntu.  Sad story.  :-/</p>
<p>We also attempted to get cycling shoes (with toe clips!) and new pedals for Evan, but the people at the local sports store seemed unknowledgeable and unwilling to help.</p>
<p>We also organised some stuff related to the WNBR in Brighton, and we posted a few updates to Facebook, blah, blah, blah, and curated some more photos.</p>
<p>Mostly, we used today to do a lot of the things that we've been trying to do for a while, but haven't found the time for.  I guess my stomach illness was a pretty good excuse to chill out for a while.  :)</p>
<p>This evening, we got to really cook the first meal on our stove (since it was broken the last time): gnocchi, pasta sauce, spinach, and cheese.  We had a cooking party under a bridge in town, proclaiming ourselves the classiest hobos in St. LÃ´.  We also made a French person happy for the first time!  A couple walked by us, and the guy was basically stumbling away due to his incapacitating laughter at our admittedly-strange situation.</p>
<p>After said delicious meal, we headed to the cinema to watch "Prince of Persia."  I remember the good ol' days when I would play the 2D game, skillfully sneaking through steel chomping walls and spike pits.  The new games are alright, too, I suppose, and actually watching the movie felt a bit like playing a video game.  A lot of its angles were game angles more than cinematography angles, and some of its CG was just poor enough to be mistakable for game quality.  Oh, and it was all dubbed in French.  My little language receptors got a workout trying to follow what the heck was going on.  The image of Persian people fuming at each other in French is an amusing one.</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/06/08/a-new-lo.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/06/10/rain.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
