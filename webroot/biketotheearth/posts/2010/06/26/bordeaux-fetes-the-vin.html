<p>We roll out of bed today at 0900 to blazing heat and the unfortunate realization that the campsite bakery (well, they have a small stand that sells bread from bakeries in town) is devoid of tasty things. While getting ourselves ready in the reception area at the campsite, we notice a listing for guided tours of the city centre; since Bordeaux has recently been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we set aside our general disdain of guided tours long enough to book it to the tourism office for 1000.</p>
<p>What follows is a monotonous spewing of centuries and kings from an almost completely disinterested balding middle-age dude aboard a bus that whizzes past nearly everything of interest. So much for guided tours. We do come across the old German submarine bays (see the photos!) and a number of older religious edifices of various description. All in all, though, not worth the 8€ a head - Bordeaux is best enjoyed on foot or bike!</p>
<p>We then promptly head out to lift our spirits after the lackluster tour - and what better than wine? For 15€ per person, you get a wine glass complete with its own holder pouch and 12 dégustations from the different regional and vintage stands set up along the riverside. Since it's still incredibly hot - it seems we crossed the magic latitude line a few days ago, and are now into blazing midday heat territory - we limit ourselves to one tasting each and seek refuge from the sun in a nice (but, as you might expect, wildly overpriced) tea house under Passage Sarget before heading to a local cybercafé to catch up on our respective emails. (Yes, it is still hard to find decent wifi! This is apparently not something that impeccably cultured France believes in.)</p>
<p>After our siesta, we drop the bikes back at the campsite and head back in to seriously check out the wine-based festivities. What follows is about 9000 deliciousness units of wine (and wine cocktails! (and mushroom omelettes!)); I even get to help make a white wine cocktail at the École du Vin tent. Yum!</p>
<p>The festival is enormous; several hundred thousand people visit the Bordeaux river promenade during the four-day-long shindig, which is more than enough to thoroughly pack the area with nearly unnavigable crowds.</p>
<p>Bordeaux is our last major stop before the Pyrénées and the crossing into Spain. According to the Camino de Santiago map we picked up on the ferry, it's a pretty serious climb over the mountains. Are we ready? I suppose we had better be...</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/06/25/peninsular.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/06/27/oil-be-glad-to-get-outta-here.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
