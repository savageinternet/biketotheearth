By the time we get in, however, it is too late for us to join them; so we wish them a pleasant weekend and grab the metro to the airport, snapping photos of the lime-green chairs to amuse ourselves on the long ride through the tunnels underneath Valencia. The subway is predictably full of tourists on their way out of Valencia, full of languages and wheeled bags. We get to the airport with a decent chunk of time remaining before boarding, especially since we have no bags to check. In the typical non-American manner, security wastes your time less aggressively here; in some countries, it is even considered sane to keep your shoes on...</p>
<p>...and we sit; travel by air is less eventful than travel by train, bike, or foot. There is no chance for scenic views, save for the brief cityscape panoramas offered during takeoff and landing - and even these are not guaranteed, as some airports lie far out in the exurbs with no line-of-sight to the cities they are nominally attached to. We board the plane, take off, and are soon in Madrid, where we have a shorter-than-expected layover (only 10 minutes!) that we use to cross the terminal, queue up, pass our documents over for more cursory inspection, and board another plane for Geneva. We land, pass quickly through the small GVA terminal, and fail to see Valkyrie's friends from CERN - so we instead head over to the other side of arrivals to use the free hotspot by one of the terminal caf√©s. We get Henning's number and call him only to find that he has been waiting there the whole time...</p>
<p>...and we go to his house to sip gin-and-tonics over chit-chat about experiences both had and missed, over pictures from our travels thus far, over discussion about anything that comes to mind; I get in some last-minute studying for a first-year legal studies examination that, due to the extraordinary inflexibility of the Canadian university system, I am now obligated to take; and we at last retire to a fold-out sofa bed - but an actual bed! This is luxury indeed on such a trip as ours...</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/07/orange-you-glad.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/09/cram-n-exam.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
