Aren't careful... minds and legs<br />
Become mushier.</i></p>
<p>Bill and Cathy are super relaxed.  It's awesome.  Our only jobs for today were basically to run errands for them.  Well, we hoed up a patch of ground quickly, but that was fairly easy.  They needed us to get clover seed and a tyre in Llíria, and we're basically free to do as we like with the rest of our day.  We headed out on our bike ride, stopping to note an ENORMOUS fig tree along the way.  Too bad there weren't any figs ripe, but Bill brought us some yesterday, so we didn't mind.  :)</p>
<p>It's still too hot to drink during the middle of the day... but in Casinos there is a bodega (wine cellar) with tapped casks of wine that you can use to taste or to fill your own bottles.  Well, the only bottles we have are our water bottles, so we went ahead and filled those.  The thing about the wine is that it's really really tasty, though, so we wanted to drink some and also to bring some back to share.  But if we only brought back 750mL, that's not enough to split 5 ways (me, Evan, Cathy, Bill, and their friend Natalie), so we filled two water bottles, drank them, filled them again, and, totally dehydrated, headed off on our real task.</p>
<p>The middle of the day is somewhat fuzzy, but we made it to Llíria (despite my falling off my bike and scraping my leg once, sigh), got the stuff, and headed back.  Evan even got some painting done in Joseph's room.  Most of the afternoon, though, was dedicated to a nap that lasted roughly until dinnertime, when Joseph offered to take us to some marble caves nearby.</p>
<p>He didn't actually have much idea where he was going; he'd been there only once before, and that time was in a car, not to mention that the look of the area we were searching in had been drastically changed by a fire recently (there was actually still a smouldering pile of garbage that we walked past).  Anyway, he couldn't find it, but a nice policeman came by and gave us directions.  When Joseph failed to follow the directions correctly, the nice policeman gave us a ride to the cave, and even walked us over to it.  The caves were pretty cool; people apparently used to live there, and they looked cut rather than carved by water.  Still, though, they were the first marble caves I've seen.  Nice!</p></div><div class="nav"><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/16/earth-wind-and-fire.html" class="nav">prev</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/biketotheearth/posts/2010/08/18/onwards-and-outwards.html" class="nav">next</a></div><div class="post-link"><a href="/index.html" class="nav">index</a></div></div></div></body></html>
